# Grimoire-Guide
Grimoire Guide is an AI powered book recommendation system which leverages statistical machine learning, data science and NLP concepts to recommend the best books to the users. Just provide a plot or description, and it will do the rest of the job for you.

## Guide for running this on local machine:

**1. Clone the repository:**  
Use the command given below in the git bash terminal:  
```git clone https://github.com/adityapradhan202/Grimoire-Guide.git```

**2. Install the dependencies:**  
Open a new terminal in the project folder and type this command:  
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

**3. Run the app:**  
In the terminal of the project folder type this command to run the app on local host:   
```streamlit run app.py```

## How it works:

Grimoire-Guide uses a simple concept of 'cosine similarity', which is available in `scikit-learn`. We can convert two separate texts into vectors or numbers and then we can use the concept of cosine similarity to see how similar the two texts are.

## Further improvements:
This is more like a practice project to understand and implement the concept of cosine similarity. Further, we can code neural networks on bigger dataset and create more robust ML application.
